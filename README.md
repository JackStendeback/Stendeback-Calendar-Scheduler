  # Updating Calender Schedule

  This application has been revamped, and now is fully functional. For the average work day(9AM-5PM), you are able to enter in notes, that will be saved directly to local storage for later viewing. Also, each hour is updated throughout the day, and color coordinated. Grey means the hour has already passed, red means the hour is in progress, and green means the hour is still yet to come! All of this  is  dynamically updated via javascript event listeners, and styled using CSS . The backbone is structured using HTML, bootstrap, and dayjs!
